## Support 

If you encounter any bugs or issues, please submit them on [GitHub](https://github.com/gflujan/mark-item-as/issues). 

You can leave comments on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mark-item-as), and I'll check them periodically, but you're more likely to get a faster response on GitHub. 

## Future Features 

- Add options to enable/disable the overlay & border 
- Ability to mark items as "ready for auction"
