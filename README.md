# Mark Item As 

## Overview 

"Mark Item As" is a World of Warcraft (WoW) utility add-on that helps you mark & automatically sell items that you don't want to keep. 

## How It Works 

MarkItemAs (a.k.a. MIA) is easy to use. Mark any items you don't want to keep with the pre-defined (or a custom) click combo and when you visit a merchant, those items will be automatically sold. 

To use the click combo, just hover your mouse over the item you want to mark and activate the combo. 

If you have duplicate or multiple items, marking one item/stack will mark all items that are the same. Similarly, un-marking one item/stack will un-mark all other items that are the same. 

Another feature of MIA is that you can auto-sort your bags after marking, un-marking, and/or selling. 

## Options & Defaults 

There are 4 main groups of options: `Marking`, `Selling`, `Sorting`, and `Chat`. 

### Marking 

#### Combo Activator Key 

This is the main mouse button that you will use to trigger marking/un-marking your items. The possible options are:

1. `LeftButton` 
2. `RightButton` (this is the default value) 

#### Combo Modifier Key 

This is the supplementary keyboard modifier that you will use with the mouse click to mark/un-mark items. The possible options are:

1. `Alt` 
2. `Ctrl` (this is the default value) 
3. `Shift` 

#### Item Overlay & Border 

The overlay & border are visual indicators to help you identify which items you've marked. The overlay is a color mask that sits on top of the items artwork. And the border is a set of colored lines that surround the item/bag slot. The color of the overlay and border are customizable using a color picker which has an alpha/transparency setting. The thickness of the border can be adjusted using a slider. The following default values are:

Overlay Color:  `{ r = 0, g = 0, b = 0, a = 0.75 }` (this is black with a 75% opacity) 

Border Color:  `{ r = 0.4, g = 0.4, b = 0.4, a = 1 }` (this is a dark-medium gray with 100% opacity) 

Border Thickness: `2` (the slider has a min value of 0 and a max value of 3) 

#### Marker Icon 

When you mark an item, a small icon will appear on top of the item and the overlay. The location and the type of icon are customizable via dropdown menus where you can select different values. The possible options are: 

##### Icon Image 

1. `Coin` (this is similar to the coin icon that Scrap displays) 
2. `Stack` 
3. `Trash` (this is the default value) 

##### Icon Location 

1. `Top Left` 
2. `Top Center` (a.k.a. TOP) 
3. `Top Right` 
4. `Left Center` (a.k.a. LEFT) 
5. `Center` 
6. `Right Center` (a.k.a. RIGHT) 
7. `Bottom Left` (this is the default value) 
8. `Bottom Center` (a.k.a. BOTTOM) 
9. `Bottom Right`
